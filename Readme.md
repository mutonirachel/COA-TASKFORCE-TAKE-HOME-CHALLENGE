# Challenges about photo gallery and coding tests
In this tasks we had three challenges one for photo gallery challenge using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however I completed it only using HTML and CSS, I did not use JavaScript in this challenge. It was about building an interactive photo gallery based on provided Figma designs. And the other two challenges are coding tests about logical thinking and coding aptitude.

#1 Photo gallery challenge:
We had five key points to work on which are Responsive Design, Figma Design Accuracy, Hover Interaction, Cross-browser Compatibility and Code Quality, and completed them.

Technologies used: 
* HTML for the contents: Images, headings, paragraphs, links and icons
* CSS for styling the contents: colors, fonts, hover, transitions, effects, and any other that were needed to have the provided designs.

Tools: Vs code was the only neccesary tool for this challenge


#2 Coding Challenge: Array Manipulation
This task was about an array of integers and a targeted sum, to determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false. And I did so. I only used JavaScript for this challenge.

This is the Example usage and output for this challenge:
const arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5];
const target = 17;
console.log(hasSubarrayWithSum(arr, target));  // Output: true

To test: simply go to terminal and enter in this challenge's folder write node plus the name of the  file.

Example:
> cd Coding-Challenge-Array
> node index.js



#3 Coding Challenge: String Transformation
This task was about reverse the entire string and replace each character with its ASCII code and If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform both operations in the order specified above. As I did so. I only used JavaScript for this challenge.

This is the Example usage and outputs for this challenge:
console.log(transformString("Hamburger")); // Output: "regrubmaH"
console.log(transformString("Pizza")); // Output: "80 105 122 122 97"
console.log(transformString("Chocolate Chip Cookie")); // Output: "eikooCpihCetalocohC"

To test: simply go to terminal and enter in this challenge's folder write node plus the name of the  file.

Example:
> cd Coding-Challenge-String
> node index.js
